# AES-Crpyto-Fundamentals
Program to encrypt the data on a text file with AES with two modes: CBC and ECB with two size of keys: 128 and 256

# TODO
In english or brazillian? Decide, your fool

Do a command line interface (maybe using ArgParser? Let's see)

Make this program to encrypt file and not only data inside the text file

Maybe a GUI? (I suck at GUI :/)
